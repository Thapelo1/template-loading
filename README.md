# Template loading

## About
This is a nice way to have a dumb presentational component be responsible for handling its own loading state and displaying a skeleton loading template.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
